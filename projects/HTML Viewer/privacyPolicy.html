                    At HTML Viewer, we believe in respecting the privacy of our users. We only store data using our Save Online feature if the user saves it. Our tools rely on JavaScript and do most of the processing in the user's browser. When users load a URL or upload a file, the data is transmitted between the server and the client, but we do not store any of this data. Any files uploaded are deleted immediately or via a cron job if there are any delete errors.
                    <br><br>
                    If someone saves a link or sensitive data online and wishes to have it removed, they can contact us via our contact page, and we will be happy to delete the data. It is important to note that we do not enforce any licenses on saved data. We reserve the right to remove any code or data without warning if it is deemed offensive, damaging, spam, or for any other reason.
                    <br><br>

                    Please be aware that Google may index public data saved using our Service. To keep your data private, we recommend logging in before protecting your data.

                    It is important not to save passwords, keys, production data, or other confidential information using our Service. We take the security of our users seriously and want to ensure that our Service is used responsibly.
